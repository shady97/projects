Android-OBD-reader application

Part of Vehicle Sensor Data Analytics project:


•	Designed a software system to track vehicle’s health and driver behavior with an ELM327 module, AWS and an Android application built upon Java, XML and MySQL

•	Incorporated a Bluetooth serial connection between vehicle’s OBD2 port and Android application through ELM327 adapter for streamlined data transfer

•	Achieved a real-time system with use of Amazon Web Services’ Simple Storage Service (S3) where data analysis was performed by thresholding methodology, ultimately displaying favorable information pertaining to engine RPM, mass air flow sensor, speed sensor on a fabricated Android application, thus helping the user to keep a track of car’s servicing needs

•	Obtained 95% efficiency over multiple sample-runs where data in .csv format was successfully uploaded to AWS’ S3 service

•	Administered geofencing API as an extended feature to restrict a car in a customizable fence utilizing phone’s location
